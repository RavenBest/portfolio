        <h2> <b>Summary</b> </h2>
        <h3> <b>What is Greenbook?</b> </h3>
        <p>Traveling has never been more convenient, accessible and efficient due to the many travel products currently in the market. However, there is one area that has not been tackled that is arguably one of the most important: safety. Inspired by the concept of the Negro Motorist Green-Book, Greenbook aims to not only enable users to conveniently plan their trips, but do so while being aware of the safest ways to travel, have quick and easy access to emergency information and report any incident that may occur.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="Problem">
        <h2> <b>Problem</b> </h2>
        <p>Everyone enjoys travel, but, many feel they have to be extra careful about where, when, and how they choose to travel, especially based on their gender and racial backgrounds. There was no product that included these concerns when helping their users plan travel.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="Solution">
        <h2> <b>Solution</b> </h2>
        <p>Greenbook solves this by putting safety in the forefront of the product. Based on responses from potential users, we have added to the current travel market to include a variety of features that can be used to improve users’ experience of safety and comfort while traveling.</p>

      <section class="Surveys">
        <h2> <b>User Surveys</b> </h2>
        <h3>Learning More About Our Users</h3>
        <p>I conducted user surveys to determine what products users currently utilize for travel, their favorite and least favorite features of those products and what features they potentially would like to see. I gathered responses from 48 participants.</p>
        <div class="takeaways-list">
          <p class="keys"> Key Takeaways </p>
          <ul class="Takeaways">
            <li>60.4% of respondents stated they would use a travel app that included information about racial incidents</li>
            <li>Top 3 areas of travel were the Midwest, South and Pacific West</li>
            <li>Airplanes and cars were selected as most used modes of transportation</li>
            <li>Current favorite features: Trip Planning, Reviews, Saving Places to stay and places to eat</li>

        <h3>How can Greenbook stand out in the current market?</h3>

            <img class="Yelp" src="images/greenbook/gb-ca/yelp.png" alt="Yelp Logo">
            <p>To see how Greenbook could compete in the current market, I compared three popular tools among my users: Yelp, Airbnb, and Google Trips. These three tools had a variety of strengths and weaknesses that were used to inform what features would be included in and the design of Greenbook. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="airbnb">
            <img class="Airbnb" src="images/greenbook/gb-ca/airbnb.png" alt="Airbnb Logo">
            <p>Yelp's standout features were the ability to search for results by category and including filters for search results. Airbnb's feature was the ability to toggle between Map and List view for search results. Google Trips' standout features were the ability to download trip information and the design and depth of their itinerary page.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="google">
            <img class="GoogleTrips" src="images/greenbook/gb-ca/google-trips.png" alt="Google Trips Logo">
            <p>After completing research, I gained a lot of valuable insight about the current tools and what features I will need to stay competitive. But the large gap in the industry is that no travel tool prioritizes safety. Google Trips does include emergency information in their product, but Greenbook can take it a step further. Greenbook's standout features are the ability to view "Incident Zones" on the user's route of travel as well as filter those zones by incident type, location sharing and recording within the platform and the ability to report an incident through the app.</p>

        <h3> <b>Defining the Personality of Greenbook</b> </h3>
        <p class="text">The Greenbook brand is modern, accessible and bright. While remaining an ode to the original concept, Greenbook's brand should stay relevant and approachable to today's audience. The design should be well explained and intuitive so users can successfully access important features efficiently. The logomark includes a symbol and wordmark. The symbol consists of the book and location icon and the wordmark consists of the “greenbook” script. The logomark can be represented by just the wordmark or the wordmark with the symbol. Originally, I had created a more vintage style logo, incorporated a globe and airplane to represent travel. But, the original concept was too detailed and did not scale down well. So, I decided to go with a simpler sketch.</p>

        <h2> <b>Wireframes</b> </h2>
        <h3> <b>Bringing Greenbook to Life</b> </h3>
        <p>I started the wireframing process by sketching my layout ideas on paper. Next, I used Figma to create low-fidelity mobile and desktop mockups that I tested using Maze. After analyzing the results and looking at feedback from the testers, I edited the low-fi screens to create the high-fidelity mockups.</p>
        <h2>Low Fidelity Mockups</h2>
        <div class="Low-Fid">

          <img class="project" src="images/greenbook/gb-lowfi/gb-incident.png" alt="Greenbook Screens">
        </div>
        <p>After adding my low-fi screens to Marvel to create the prototypes, I imported the prototypes into Maze to conduct the user tests. I tested 4 tasks: Plan a New Trip, View Incident Zones, View Emergency Contacts and Report an Incident. The first round of my low-fidelity mock ups were only moderately successful. Based on results from the first low-fi test, I incorporated several changes to the wireframes. On the itinerary welcome screen and the "Your Route" pafe, I added instructional blurbs to onboard new users and explain the navigation. After incorporating the changes, I retested my low-fi mockups.</p>
        <p>The second round of my user tests were much more successful. 100% completed "Plan a New Trip," 75% completed "View Incident Zones," 83.3% completed "View Emergency Contacts," and 100% completed "Report an Incident." I felt the results from the second test were strong enough that I could move forward with the high fidelity mockups. I did get some added feedback from tests, users mentioned the app was very well thought out and detail-oriented. They mentioned that it would be nice if Emergency Numbers were clickable so you could call directly which is a feature I will consider for the desktop app.</p>

        <p>The original concept I created for the high-fidelity mockups, may have successfully incorporated the "bright," aspect of the brand, but not "modern" or "accessible." The background pattern was too bold and made the text hard to read. The icons and buttons were far too big and felt outdated. For my second iteration, I revisited design standards to make sure I was utilizing the proper proportions for icons and buttons. I also looked at <a href="https://pttrns.com/">pttrns.com</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com/">dribbble.com</a> for layout inspirations. and reference.</p>
        <p>After completing my second iteration for my high-fidelity mockups, I tested them again using Maze. Overall, the results from my high-fidelity prototype tests were an improvement of and more successful than the low-fidelity prototypes. I had a few small changes to make, though, based on user feedback. In the "Your Routes" section, I added more hierarchy to the page to better guide users to the filters and incident zone. I turned the filter drop down into a button and changed the color and weight of the incident zone so it stood out more.</p>

            <p>The Itinerary page houses all of the information about the user's trip. From here, the user can view their route based on their mode of transportation, view, find and make hotel reservations, find places to eat and things to do, view emergency contacts based on their location and report an incident.</p>

            <p>The Route page shows the user their recommended path of travel based on their mode of transportation. Users can toggle between map and list view as well as view "Incident Zones." An Incident Zone is an area that a user may want to avoid based on the filter they select. They can filter Incident Zones by, crime, gendered incidents and racial incidents. Once they select a filter, the user can then click on an Incident Zone to learn more about what happened in that area.</p>

            <p>The Reservations page allows users to search for, book and view their hotel reservations. After users enter their travel information and select a search result, they are brought to this page where they can view general information about the hotel, photos, and reviews and reserve their room.</p>

            <p>In the Emergency Contacts page, users can view emergency numbers, find local hospitals and police stations, share their location and record. Safety being the top priority of the product, I made sure to incorporate all of the features survey respondents selected for what they'd like to see in the app.</p>

        <h2> <b>Conclusion</b> </h2>
        <h3> <b>Everything I Learned</b> </h3>
          <p>I was very excited about the ideation and creation of this product. It’s something I personally would use and was very excited to see what majority of my user test respondents felt it was needed as well. This project was especially personal to me as well as the trip outlined in the prototype to Hilton Head, SC was a road trip I made every summer with my family during my childhood. This solo project taught me a variety of things:</p>
          <ul class="conclusion-list">
            <li>That the best inspiration can be found in the most unassuming ways. I came to this idea after reading a twitter thread where people were listing cities to avoid while traveling through Texas based on past racial incidents. One tweeter actually stated they wanted a resource like this to be turned into an app.</li>
            <li>Sizing is key! As you could probably see from my wireframes, the sizing of my icons and navigation bars were extremely big, I made sure to adjust the sizing to fit closer to the standard.</li>
            <li>Taking your time during the initial wireframing and mockup creation, saves you time in the end. After learning my lesson from my <a href="https://ravenbest.design/project.html">IDEAHUB</a> project, I spent a lot more time sketching and thinking about the design for my prototype.</li>
            <li>Don’t be ashamed to use references! My first iteration was completely my own ideation, and as “bright” as it was, it was absolutely too busy and even a little dated. I visited sites like pttrns and dribbble to see what current designers are creating.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>My favorite parts of the project were branding and analyzing user test results. I was very passionate about bringing this product to life and was extremely grateful for the depth of responses I received from my user surveys.</p>
